I have created a maven project and written the source code in index.jsp using HTML and javascript.
The code has 2 input check boxes and will give the sum of 2 input fields in the result input box. 
If any of the number is not valid it will display an error message and will ask you to input the number again.

Maven version used :  3.5.4
Apache Tomcat Server used : 8.5
